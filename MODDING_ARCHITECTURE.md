# Modular Tower Defense Game - Modding Architecture

## Overview
This tower defense game is designed from the ground up to support extensive modding capabilities. The architecture follows modular design principles to allow players to easily add, modify, or replace any game element through a comprehensive plugin system.

## Core Architectural Principles

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Central Event Bus**: All game actions (tower placement, enemy spawning, combat, wave progression) communicate through a central event system
- **Loose Coupling**: Systems communicate via events rather than direct references
- **Mod Integration**: Mods can listen to and emit events to interact with core systems

### Component-Based Design
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Towers, enemies, and game objects use ECS pattern for maximum flexibility
- **Modular Components**: Behavior, rendering, stats, and logic separated into discrete components
- **Dynamic Composition**: Mods can add new components or modify existing ones

### Data-Driven Configuration
- **JSON/YAML Configs**: All game content defined in easily editable configuration files
- **Hot Reloading**: Changes to configs can be applied without restarting the game
- **Validation**: Automatic validation ensures mod configs are valid and safe

## Modular System Design

### 1. Core Engine Layer
**Game Loop Manager**
- Handles update/render cycles and frame timing
- Provides hooks for mods to inject custom logic

**Event Bus**
- Central message/event system for all game communication
- Type-safe event definitions with TypeScript support
- Event filtering and prioritization

**Resource Manager**
- Asset loading and caching for textures, sounds, and data files
- Support for mod asset overrides and additions
- Lazy loading for performance optimization

**Plugin Registry**
- Dynamic loading and management of mods
- Dependency resolution between mods
- Version compatibility checking

### 2. Game Systems Layer (All Modular)

**Tower System**
- JSON-based tower definitions with behavior scripts
- Modular upgrade trees and evolution paths
- Pluggable targeting algorithms and special abilities

**Enemy System**
- Modular enemy creation with interchangeable components:
  - Movement patterns (ground, air, teleporting)
  - Visual modules (body, effects, animations)
  - Behavior modules (shields, healing, splitting)
  - Stat modules (health, speed, armor, resistances)

**Combat System**
- Extensible damage types and resistance systems
- Pluggable projectile behaviors and effects
- Custom status effects and debuffs

**Wave System**
- Configurable wave patterns and enemy compositions
- Dynamic difficulty scaling
- Special event waves and boss encounters

**Map System**
- Grid-based tile system with special tile types
- Custom map loading with validation
- Interactive map elements and environmental hazards

**Economy System**
- Flexible resource and currency management
- Custom scoring and reward systems
- Economic balance validation tools

### 3. Mod API Design

**Tower API**
```javascript
// Register new tower type
registerTower({
  id: "ice_tower",
  name: "Frost Tower",
  config: "towers/ice_tower.json",
  behavior: "towers/ice_tower_behavior.js",
  upgrades: ["frost_upgrade", "freeze_upgrade"]
});
```

**Enemy API**
```javascript
// Create modular enemy
registerEnemy({
  id: "armored_flyer",
  components: {
    movement: "flying",
    armor: "heavy",
    special: "magic_shield"
  }
});
```

**Wave API**
```javascript
// Define custom wave patterns
registerWavePattern({
  id: "boss_rush",
  waves: [...],
  difficulty: "extreme"
});
```

**Map API**
```javascript
// Add custom tile types
registerTileType({
  id: "lava_tile",
  effects: ["damage_over_time"],
  visual: "lava_animation"
});
```

**UI API**
```javascript
// Add custom UI elements
registerUIComponent({
  id: "tower_stats_panel",
  position: "sidebar",
  component: CustomStatsPanel
});
```
