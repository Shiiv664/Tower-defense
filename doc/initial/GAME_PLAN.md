# Tower Defense Game - Commercial Project

## Objective
Develop and publish a commercial tower defense game as a PWA to Google Play Store and other app stores.

## Technology Stack
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **Three.js**: WebGL graphics and animations
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Modular architecture for performance and extensibility (see [doc/initial/ECS_ARCHITECTURE.md](doc/initial/ECS_ARCHITECTURE.md))
- **Tile System**: Flexible property-based world tiles supporting modding (see [doc/initial/TILE_SYSTEM.md](doc/initial/TILE_SYSTEM.md))
- **Pathfinding System**: Flow field pathfinding with organic movement behaviors (see [doc/initial/PATHFINDING_ARCHITECTURE.md](doc/initial/PATHFINDING_ARCHITECTURE.md))
- **Deterministic Systems**: Seed-based randomization for replay and leaderboard functionality (see [doc/initial/DETERMINISTIC_ARCHITECTURE.md](doc/initial/DETERMINISTIC_ARCHITECTURE.md))
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App capabilities
- **Capacitor**: Native app wrapper for app stores

## Core Features

- **WebGL Graphics**: Smooth 60fps performance
- **Sprite Animations**: Enemy movement, tower attacks, effects
- **Mobile-First**: Touch controls, responsive design
- **Offline Capable**: Play without internet connection
- **Progressive**: Installable from browser
- **Modding Support**: Extensible architecture for community mods (see [doc/initial/MODDING_ARCHITECTURE.md](doc/initial/MODDING_ARCHITECTURE.md))
- **Deterministic Gameplay**: Seed-based randomization for reproducible games
- **Replay System**: Watch any completed game from start to finish
- **Leaderboard Integration**: Global rankings with score validation
- **Spectating**: View top-scoring games as replays

## Monetization Strategy
